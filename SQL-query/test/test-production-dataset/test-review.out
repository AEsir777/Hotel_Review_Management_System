"jNwGwhrvj85SrR96c-Y8Tw", 2014-08-18, We went to IndeBlue due to its great proximity to the Walnut St. theaters and based on other's reviews...and we were not disappointed. The food was delicious! We had the flash fried spinach and naan pizza as appetizers and the tastes were spectacular. Then we had a basil chicken skewer and a lamb rogan josh which were also full of flavor and very filling. The atmosphere, staff and location were all excellent. I have already recommended it to several friends and will definitely go back., 5, 2

"-QGsoLVpuJlduGCcJX6-NQ", 2014-06-10, My family and I order from them very often, China Dragon is our go to place for Asian cuisine. They are always pleasant in person and on the phone, and the prices are by far the best around. Their delivery always comes a few minutes before they say it will and most importantly the food is YUMMY! We love their pork fried rice, egg rolls, shrimp toast, and the hot and sour soup is a must try! Tonight we tried their Pad Thai for the first time and it was to die for!! 

I honestly can't believe they don't have more reviews on here! Try them out, you won't be disappointed!!, 4, 0, Kristin, "PcYMJJCbvtu3roNBdPuZxQ"
